# EasyCap SM USB 007 External Analog Video Capture Card Windows 10 x64 Drivers


## Instructions

1. Make sure that you have the correct device compare with the photos below.
2. Open Windows Device Manager and check for unknown devices (something like: `SM-USB 007`)
3. Right-click on the device to show properties and on the details tab, go the Hardware ID section. Check if your hardware ID is:
```
  USB\VID_1C88&PID_003C&REV_0100
  USB\VID_1C88&PID_003C
```

4. Alternatively, you can use the following PowerShell command:
 ```
  Get-PnpDevice -PresentOnly -Status ERROR,DEGRADED,UNKNOWN
 ```
5. If your device matches, you can try to install these drivers. But first, make a Windows System Restore Point.
6. Clone or download this repository and Unzip the [file](EasyCap-SM-USB-007-Windows-10-x64-drivers.zip)
7. Right-click on the `SmiUsbGrabber3C.inf` file and choose Install

## Personal Notes:
- VirusTotal check: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/729403b5f4e38375bb556e5bd9b97b94ed74e6cd5a56eae9038c69035b1961bc/detection

- I had a lot of problems finding a "safe" driver to my Windows Pro x64 machine including a nefarious BSOD each time I plugged the USB device.

- Try to use a USB 3.0 port (to make sure that you have enough current to power the device and the maximum bandwidth - I know that is a USB 2.0 device but you don't lose anything trying). Also, when capturing video try to disconnect any adjacent USB devices near to prevent interferences.

- If you want to buy a similar EasyCap device, I strongly recommend finding another better alternatives. It's a low-cost device with poor capabilities and the audio hardware it's almost unusable 

- To capture video, use [VirtualDub](https://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualdub/files/virtualdub-win/1.10.4.35491/) , and make sure that you select the correct input source
